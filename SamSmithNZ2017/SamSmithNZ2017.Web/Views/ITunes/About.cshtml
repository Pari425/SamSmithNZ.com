    This page begun as just an experiment, but it grew to something that seems to get a few random hits. <br /><br />
    This is the second iteration of the page, with more functionality, data and better performance. The data import process is now relatively streamlined and quick - even with Apple's weird XML iTunes library database<br /><br />
    Drop me a <a href="mailto:samsmithnz@gmail.com">mail</a> if you have ideas to improve it or would like to tell me what you use it for! (samsmithnz at gmail.com). More details about the architecture can be found <a href="https://www.samsmithnz.com/home/about">here</a>.
