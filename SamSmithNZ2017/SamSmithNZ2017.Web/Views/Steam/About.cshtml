    This page begun as just an experiment, but it grew to something that still seems to get a lot of random hits. <br /><br />
    This is the second iteration of the page, with more functionality and better performance. Ads do help to pay for this service.<br /><br />
    Drop me a <a href="mailto:samsmithnz@gmail.com">mail</a> if you have ideas to improve it or would like to tell me what you use it for! (samsmithnz at gmail.com)<br /><br /><br />
    Note that this page is specifically not using HTTPS for a few reasons:
    <ul>
        <li>Steam doesn't host its images in HTTPS, so if you try to host it with HTTPS modern browers will throw mixed content errors and not load</li>
        <li>This data is not transfering any personally identifiable information</li>
    </ul>
